Instructions for transfer learning using my T2T setup

**Credit:** The initial setup for running training sessions using Tensor2Tensor was provided to me by Jibia Shen. I adapted it for my own transfer learning purposes.

**Disclaimer:** I'm in no way suggesting Tensor2Tensor is the only way or necessarily the best way to train MT models. In the good old days (Winter 2019 :D), when I was experimenting with universal transfer learning I started with it and happened to train my favorite parent model so far using it. So here we are. 

**Prerequisites:** Have [Tensor2Tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor) installed, and be reasonably comfortable with it. For me, its code gets complicated very quickly. So I've always been loosely comfortable with it. You should be good by going through README.
